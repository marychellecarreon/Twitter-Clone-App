# Twitter Clone App using Ruby on Rails (1st project)

This is excerpted from the Ruby on Rails tutorial book from Michael Hartl.
And, I have a great time doing this project.



## Getting Started
 - Create a local copy by cloning the repository:
 ```sh
          $ https://github.com/marychellecarreon/Twitter-Clone-App
 ```
 - Install all the needed gem
 ```sh 
          $ bundle install --without production
```
 - Migrate the database
  ```sh 
          $ rails db:migrate
```       
 - Run the test suite to check if the app is working properly
 ```sh 
          $ rails test
```   
  - You are now ready to run the app in the local server
 
  ```sh 
          $ rails server
```   

## To do list
 - To style this app similar with Twitter design
